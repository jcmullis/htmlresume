					<h1>About</h1>
				</div>

				<div class="sectionContent">
					<p>Highly accomplished healthcare manager with invaluable experience leading, mentoring and
						developing medical professionals. After many years in healthcare management, I am looking to
						make a career change into a field of study that has always peaked my interest - cloud-based
						technologies and data migration. I pride myself on my ability to be flexible, a quick study, and
						a true benefit in any collaborative co-working environment. I am excited about starting a new
						chapter in my career and expanding my skillset within the cloud computing realm. I currently
						hold 4 AWS certifications and have worked on various AWS cloud-based projects.</p>

					<h2>Respiratory Therapy Manager</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">June 2017 - Present</p>
					<p>Along with assisting in regular staff duties when urgently needed, I am additionally responsible
						for many Human Resource tasks such as: conducting yearly employee evaluations, sometimes
						resulting in either compensation gains or reductions; conducting new applicant interviews, as
						well as weighing in on all department hiring and termination decisions; new staff orientations,
						including on-boarding and new hire paperwork compliance; as well as conducting yearly education
						to the entire RT staff. I continuously assist with critical patients, audit staff charting and
						documentation for accuracy and HIPPA compliance, manage ABG machines, and maintain a
						productivity level of 98-102% for a department of 120 across 5 campuses. That, in addition to
						weekly shift scheduling, daily task assignments, budgeting and general employee management -
						sometimes resulting in employee disruption mitigation due to departmental grievances. </p>
